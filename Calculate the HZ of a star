--- Stage One ---
Estimate stars absolute luminosity based on the stars apparent visual magnitude
Step 1) Estimate the stars absolute luminosity based on the  stars apparent magnitude.
Mv = Absolute Magnitude of the host star
mv = Apparent Magnitude of the host star
d = Distance in parsecs from earth

M = m - 5log(d / 10)

Step 2) Calculate Biometric Magnitude
Mbol = Bolometric Magnitude of the star
Mv = Absolute magnitude of the star
BC = Bolometric Correction constant

Mbol = Mv + BC

Step 3) Calculate the absolute luminosity of the host star

Lstar/Lsun = the absolute luminosity of the host star in terms of the absolute luminosity of the sun
Mbol star = the bolometric magnitude of the host star
Mbol sun = the bolometric magnitude of the sun = 4.72

2.5 is a constant value used for comparing stellar luminosities -- known as "Pogson's Ratio."



Lstar/Lsun = 10[Mbol star = Mbol sun] under -2.5
